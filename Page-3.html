        <h3 class="me">There aren't a lot of prerequisites a carpenter may need to get into the field of work.
            If you become a union man your High school diploma, or GED would suffice. After that,
            enrolling in some type of trade school would greatly improve your skills in a safe environment.
            Once you start working you instantly start your apprenticeship, where you earn only a percentage of
            what a journeyman earns. You can also complete a course to obtain a certificate/ licence to
            show you are well versed in your work. Some trades may require you to obtain one of these licences,
            which are given to you once you pass a final exam proving to the examiner that you are deserving of said licence.
