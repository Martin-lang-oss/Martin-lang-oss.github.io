        <h3 class="me"> Carpentry is a highly skilled trade that plays a vital role in the construction of our infrastructure. 
            Like many trades they are dangers and hazards that come with a job. As an example cut and abrasions are a common work injury in a construction site,
            same as falling off elevated surfaces, and overexertion from working in a repetitive motion or awkward positions.
            There are ways to avoid these injuries but not prevent them. Some way are by following the (PPE) personal protective equipment that
            include wearing safety goggles, gloves, ear protection, and a dust mask.
