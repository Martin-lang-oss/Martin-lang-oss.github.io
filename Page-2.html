            During the construction of a building carpenters work in different stages of the project.
            This means that there are different types of carpenters needed for every phase of the construction.
            For example there are :

            <ul>
                <li>
                Rough carpenters: Framers work at the beginning of a construction project.
                They create the framework that the rest of the project will work off of.
                They are in charge of reinforcing the structure so that it is strong enough
                to withstand the weight of the building. 
                </li>
                <li>
                Finish carpenters: Finish carpenters are the opposite of rough carpenters.
                Finish carpenters focus on detailing a building: installing doors, windows,
                sliddings, etc..
                </li>
            </ul>
