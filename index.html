        <h3 class="me">Have you ever stopped to wonder, who built the ginormous skyscrapers in the city, or the strong house that shields you from the harsh weather?
            Carpenters are needed world wide, whether unionized or not, they have helped build the world around us-- from homes to skyscrapers they do it all.
            Carpentry is a job profession which specializes in many different things: wood working, installation, blueprint reading, and repairing structures and
            objects, etc. With the introduction of power tools carpentry has become much more efficient. There is not much you need to become a trade worker,
            simply having a high school diploma will suffice. An enormous con to carpentry is the physical starine it puts on your body. However, there will 
            always be a demand for carpenters since there will  always be a need for improvement in the area and renovations of specific structures.
